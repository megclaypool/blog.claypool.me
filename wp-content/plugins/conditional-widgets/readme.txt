Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 4.6
Stable tag: trunk

Easily control the display of widgets based on pages or categories

== Description ==

IMPORTANT: If upgrading a MultiSite installation from Conditional Widgets 1.x to 2.x, you'll need to visit the dashboard of each site in order to make Conditional Widgets function on that site.  If you have a large number of sites, consider using this small plugin to assist you in doing so: https://github.com/MadtownLems/cets-multisite-dashboard-crawler

This plugin adds a form to each widget on the Widgets panel which allows users to choose which pages and/or categories the widget is either displayed on or hidden from.

For each widget, you can choose criteria to either SHOW or HIDE the widget, based on a number of categories.  The interface is quite intuitive, and requires no knowledge of php or conditional tags.


== Screenshots ==

1. Each widget gets an expandable form at the bottom of it for controlling display options on the home page and for both pages and categories.


== Installation ==

Standard Installation Procedure

1. Upload the `cets-conditional-widgets` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

* IMPORTANT! If updating in a MultiSite/Network environment, you'll need to visit the dashboard of every site for the plugin to continue to work properly.  If you have a large network, consider using my helper plugin: <a href='https://github.com/MadtownLems/cets-multisite-dashboard-crawler'>https://github.com/MadtownLems/cets-multisite-dashboard-crawler</a>
